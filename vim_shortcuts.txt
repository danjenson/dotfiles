REQUIRED BACKGROUND:
===============================================================================
run `vimtutor` from command line.

SETUP:
===============================================================================
set https_proxy:
$ export https_proxy=fwdproxy.any.facebook.com:8080
$ cd && git clone https://github.com/danjenson/dotfiles.git
$ ln -s dotfiles/.vimrc .
[OPTIONAL]: copy fb specific shortcuts
$ cp /home/danj/.vimfb .

System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifer Keys... -> Caps Lock Key: ^ Control
NOTE: if you have multiple keyboards, make sure you do this for all of them
to avoid confusion.
[OPTIONAL]: install pathogen and vim commentary
Pathogen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

BASIC CONCEPTS:
===============================================================================
Vim modes:
Normal
Insert
Command
Search
Visual
Operator-pending
Insert Normal (Ctrl+o, one bullet style)
Replace

Operator + Motion = Action

Escape to Normal Mode:
Escape      return to normal mode
Ctrl+[      return to normal mode (same as Escape, but faster)

SHORTCUTS:
===============================================================================
Basic movement* (Normal mode):
(g)j        move down a (virtual) line
(g)k        move up a (virtual) line
(g)l        move right a (virtual) line
(g)h        move left a (virtual) line
(g)0        move to beginning of (virtual) line
(g)^        move to first char in (virtual) line
(g)$        move to last char in (virtual) line
w           move to beginning of next word
W           move to beginning of next WORD
e           move to end of next word
E           move to end of next WORD
ge          move backwoard to end of previous word
b           move to the beginning of a word (B for WORD)
gg          move to first line in file
G           move to last line in file
{n}G        move to line n in file
Shift+]     move down a block
Shift+[     move up a block
Ctrl+o      move to previous jump point
zz          move current line to center of screen

*For more, run :h motion.txt in vim

Moving and switching modes (Normal mode):
.           repeat last insert mode sequence (. Formula: one move, one execute)
u           undo last insert mode sequence
a           move right one char and switch to insert mode
A           move to end of line and switch to insert mode
i           switch to insert mode at the current position
I           move to beginning of line and switch to insert mode
O           new line before current line and switch to insert mode
o           new line after current line and switch to insert mode

Editing (Normal, Visual modes):
c{motion}   change
C           change to end of line
d{motion}   delete
D           delete to end of line

y{motion}   yank into register
yy          yank current line
p           paste after current position
P           paste before current position
g~{motion}  swap case
gu{motion}  make lowercase
gU{motion}  make uppercase
>{motion}   shift right
>>          shift current line right
<{motion}   shift left
<<          shit current line left
J           join current line and next line
={motion}   autoindent
!{motion}   drops into command mode with specified range selected

ex. dt' = delete from cursor to char before '

Editing (Insert mode):
Ctrl+n      autocomplete with next option
Ctrl+p      autocomplete with previous option
Ctrl+w      delete back one word
Ctrl+u      delete back to start of line

Editing (Replace mode):
r{char}     replace current char with {char}
R{chars}    replace all chars on line with chars until escaped

Searching (Search mode, initiated from Normal mode):
*           search file for every other occurence of word under cursor

?{pattern}  search entire file backwards for pattern
n           next search result

F{char}     same as above, but reverse direction
t{char}     find the next char in the currnet line; place cursor before char
T{char}     same as above, but reverse direction
;           repeat last search (often used in conjunction with .)
,           repeat last search in reverse direction

Selection (Visual mode):

V           initiate visual mode at line level
Ctrl+v      initiate visual mode at block level
gv          reselect last visual selection

ap          current paragraph plus one space
i{punct}    select inside {punct}
a{punct}    select around {punct}
{punct}     any of:  ) } ] ' " ` >
